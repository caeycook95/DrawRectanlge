# DrawRectanlge

This program uses java swing to allow the user to draw rectangle. The rectangles can be saved as an image or the drawing can be cleared. You can also check the checkboxes to highlight the intersections of the rectangles, draw the union of the rectangles and, highlight the common area of all the rectangles if there are any.
